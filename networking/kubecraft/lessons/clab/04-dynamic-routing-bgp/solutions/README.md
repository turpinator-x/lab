# Lesson 4 Solutions

Reference solutions for the Dynamic Routing with BGP exercises.

## Exercise 1: Deploy and Configure eBGP

**Step 1: Deploy the topology.**

```bash
$ cd lessons/clab/04-dynamic-routing-bgp
$ containerlab deploy -t topology/lab.clab.yml
```

**Steps 3-4: Cross-subnet pings FAIL -- only local routes exist.**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 2 -W 3 10.1.4.2
PING 10.1.4.2 (10.1.4.2): 56 data bytes

--- 10.1.4.2 ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
```

Each router only knows about its directly connected subnets. srl1 has no route to 10.1.4.0/24 (host2's subnet), so it drops the packet.

**Routing table on srl1 (only `local` routes):**

```
A:srl1# show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary
+------------+-------+------------+-------------------+----------+
|   Prefix   | Type  | Route-Owner| Next-hop          | Metric   |
+============+=======+============+===================+==========+
| 10.1.1.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/1.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.2.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/2.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.3.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/3.0    | 0        |
+------------+-------+------------+-------------------+----------+
```

Only the three directly connected subnets appear. No remote subnets -- routers have no way to reach each other's hosts.

**Unconfigured srl2-srl3 link (ethernet-1/3 on srl2):**

```
A:srl2# show interface ethernet-1/3
===============================================================================
  ethernet-1/3 is up, speed 25G, type None
    ethernet-1/3.0 is admin-state disable
      Network-instance: --
      Oper state      : down
      IPv4 addr       : --
===============================================================================
```

ethernet-1/3 is physically up (the cable is wired in the topology) but has no subinterface configured and is not assigned to a network instance. This link will be activated in exercise 2.

**Step 6: Apply BGP configuration via gNMIc.**

```bash
$ gnmic -a clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-srl1:57400 -u admin -p NokiaSrl1! \
    --skip-verify -e json_ietf set --request-file configs/srl1-bgp.json
{
  "time": "2026-03-15T12:01:15Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "routing-policy/policy[name=import-all]"
    },
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "routing-policy/policy[name=export-connected]"
    },
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "routing-policy/policy[name=export-bgp]"
    },
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "network-instance[name=default]/protocols/bgp"
    }
  ]
}
```

Repeat for srl2 and srl3 with their respective config files. Each config creates three routing policies and enables BGP:

- **`import-all`** -- accepts all received routes (SR Linux default-deny requires an explicit import policy)
- **`export-connected`** -- matches directly connected subnets (`protocol: local`) and advertises them; unmatched routes pass to the next policy via `default-action: next-policy`
- **`export-bgp`** -- matches BGP-learned routes and re-advertises them to other peers, enabling transit routing through the hub

**Step 7: BGP neighbors all Established.**

```
A:srl1# show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| Peer          | Group  | AS     | Admin     | Session| Rcv    | Active |
|               |        |        | State     | State  | Routes | Routes |
+===============+========+========+===========+========+========+========+
| 10.1.2.2      |ebgp-pe | 65002  | enable    |establis| 2      | 2      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| 10.1.3.2      |ebgp-pe | 65003  | enable    |establis| 2      | 2      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
```

Both sessions show `established` -- the only healthy BGP state. srl1 receives 2 routes from each peer: srl2 advertises 10.1.2.0/24 and 10.1.4.0/24 (its connected subnets), and srl3 advertises 10.1.3.0/24 and 10.1.5.0/24.

**Step 8: Cross-subnet pings now work.**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.1.4.2
PING 10.1.4.2 (10.1.4.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.1.4.2: seq=0 ttl=62 time=2.567 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.4.2: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.234 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.4.2: seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.987 ms
--- 10.1.4.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
```

**Step 9: Routing table now shows `bgp` routes for remote subnets.**

```
A:srl1# show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary
+------------+-------+------------+-------------------+----------+
|   Prefix   | Type  | Route-Owner| Next-hop          | Metric   |
+============+=======+============+===================+==========+
| 10.1.1.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/1.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.2.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/2.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.3.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/3.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.4.0/24| bgp   | bgp_mgr   | 10.1.2.2          | 0        |
| 10.1.5.0/24| bgp   | bgp_mgr   | 10.1.3.2          | 0        |
+------------+-------+------------+-------------------+----------+
```

**Before and after comparison:**

| Prefix | Before (no routes) | After (BGP) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| 10.1.4.0/24 | Not present -- dropped | Type: `bgp`, Owner: `bgp_mgr`, Metric: 0 |
| 10.1.5.0/24 | Not present -- dropped | Type: `bgp`, Owner: `bgp_mgr`, Metric: 0 |

Before BGP, routers only knew their directly connected subnets. Packets to remote subnets were dropped because there was no route. After BGP, each router learned about remote subnets from its peers and installed them in the forwarding table automatically.

**Key lesson:** Without a routing protocol, routers are islands -- they only know about their own interfaces. BGP bridges the gap by having routers exchange reachability information with their peers. No manual route configuration is needed.

---

## Exercise 2: Enable Direct Link and Path Selection

**Step 1: Traceroute BEFORE the new link (3 router hops through the hub).**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host2 traceroute -n -w 2 10.1.5.2
traceroute to 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.1.4.1  1.234 ms  0.567 ms  0.432 ms
 2  10.1.2.1  1.456 ms  1.123 ms  0.987 ms
 3  10.1.3.2  1.678 ms  1.345 ms  1.234 ms
 4  10.1.5.2  2.123 ms  1.567 ms  1.456 ms
```

The path is host2 -> srl2 (10.1.4.1) -> srl1 (10.1.2.1) -> srl3 (10.1.3.2) -> host3 (10.1.5.2). Three router hops because srl2 has no direct route to srl3 -- it must go through the hub.

**Step 2: Configure the srl2-srl3 interfaces.**

```bash
$ gnmic -a clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-srl2:57400 -u admin -p NokiaSrl1! \
    --skip-verify -e json_ietf set --request-file configs/srl2-new-link.json
{
  "time": "2026-03-15T12:05:00Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "interface[name=ethernet-1/3]"
    },
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "network-instance[name=default]"
    }
  ]
}

$ gnmic -a clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-srl3:57400 -u admin -p NokiaSrl1! \
    --skip-verify -e json_ietf set --request-file configs/srl3-new-link.json
{
  "time": "2026-03-15T12:05:05Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "interface[name=ethernet-1/3]"
    },
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "network-instance[name=default]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 3: Add BGP neighbors for the new link.**

```bash
$ gnmic -a clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-srl2:57400 -u admin -p NokiaSrl1! \
    --skip-verify -e json_ietf set --request-file configs/srl2-bgp-srl3.json
{
  "time": "2026-03-15T12:05:30Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "network-instance[name=default]/protocols/bgp/neighbor[peer-address=10.1.6.2]"
    }
  ]
}

$ gnmic -a clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-srl3:57400 -u admin -p NokiaSrl1! \
    --skip-verify -e json_ietf set --request-file configs/srl3-bgp-srl2.json
{
  "time": "2026-03-15T12:05:35Z",
  "results": [
    {
      "operation": "UPDATE",
      "path": "network-instance[name=default]/protocols/bgp/neighbor[peer-address=10.1.6.1]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Step 4: New BGP session established.**

```
A:srl2# show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| Peer          | Group  | AS     | Admin     | Session| Rcv    | Active |
|               |        |        | State     | State  | Routes | Routes |
+===============+========+========+===========+========+========+========+
| 10.1.2.1      |ebgp-pe | 65001  | enable    |establis| 3      | 3      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| 10.1.6.2      |ebgp-pe | 65003  | enable    |establis| 2      | 1      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
```

srl2 now has two BGP peers: srl1 (via 10.1.2.1) and srl3 (via 10.1.6.2). The new session to srl3 shows `established`. srl2 receives 2 routes from srl3 (10.1.3.0/24 and 10.1.5.0/24) but only installs 1 as active -- specifically, 10.1.5.0/24 is now preferred via the direct link because it has a shorter AS path.

**Step 5: Traceroute AFTER the new link (2 router hops, direct).**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host2 traceroute -n -w 2 10.1.5.2
traceroute to 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.1.4.1  1.234 ms  0.567 ms  0.432 ms
 2  10.1.6.2  1.345 ms  0.987 ms  0.876 ms
 3  10.1.5.2  1.567 ms  1.123 ms  1.012 ms
```

The path is now host2 -> srl2 (10.1.4.1) -> srl3 (10.1.6.2) -> host3 (10.1.5.2). Two router hops -- srl1 is bypassed entirely.

**Why BGP chose the direct path:** BGP uses a best path algorithm to select between multiple routes to the same prefix. The algorithm evaluates attributes in strict order:

| Step | Attribute | Old Path (via srl1) | New Path (via srl3) |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Local Preference | default (100) | default (100) |
| 2 | **AS Path Length** | **[65001, 65003] = 2 hops** | **[65003] = 1 hop** |
| 3 | Origin | IGP (i) | IGP (i) |
| 4 | MED | not set | not set |
| 5 | eBGP vs iBGP | eBGP | eBGP |
| 6 | Router ID | n/a (already decided) | n/a |

Step 1 is a tie (both use default Local Preference). Step 2 breaks it -- the direct path has a shorter AS path (1 hop vs 2 hops), so BGP selects it. Steps 3-6 are never reached.

You can verify this with `show network-instance default protocols bgp routes ipv4 prefix 10.1.5.0/24 detail` on srl2. The output shows `MED is -, No LocalPref` (both at defaults) and the AS path for each received route.

In lesson 03, adding a cable accomplished nothing. The physical link existed, but without manually adding static routes on both srl2 and srl3, it sat idle. With BGP, the new link was automatically discovered and traffic shifted within seconds. This is the fundamental difference between static and dynamic routing: dynamic protocols react to topology changes on their own.

**Key lesson:** BGP's best path algorithm selected the direct path because it has a shorter AS path. In this lab, AS Path Length is the deciding factor because all other attributes (Local Preference, Origin, MED) are equal. In production networks, operators use Local Preference and MED to influence path selection beyond what AS path length provides.

## Exercise 3: Break/Fix -- Missing Export Policy

**Symptom: host1 and host2 cannot reach host3, but host3 can reach them.**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 -W 5 10.1.5.2
PING 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2): 56 data bytes

--- 10.1.5.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host3 ping -c 3 10.1.1.2
PING 10.1.1.2 (10.1.1.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.1.1.2: seq=0 ttl=62 time=2.345 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.2: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.123 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.1.2: seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.987 ms
--- 10.1.1.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
```

The asymmetry is the clue. host3 can ping out (it has routes from srl1 and srl2) but nobody can reach host3 (srl3 is not advertising its routes).

**BGP neighbor detail on srl3 showing sent-routes=0:**

```
A:srl3# show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor 10.1.3.1 detail
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Peer: 10.1.3.1                                                     |
| Group: ebgp-peers                                                   |
| Peer AS: 65001                                                      |

| Last state: established                                             |
| Export policy: --                                                   |
| Import policy: ['import-all']                                       |
|                                                                     |
| Messages:                                                           |
|   Sent:          12    Received:      14                            |
| Routes:                                                             |
|   Received:       3    Active:         3                            |
|   Sent:           0                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The critical fields: `Export policy: --` (no export policy) and `Sent: 0` (srl3 is advertising zero routes). The session is `established` -- the TCP connection and BGP OPEN/KEEPALIVE exchange are working perfectly. The problem is in the UPDATE messages: srl3 has nothing to announce because the export policy was deleted.

**Why this happens:** SR Linux is secure by default. BGP sessions use a default-deny model for route export. Without an explicit export policy, a router receives routes from its peers (it can learn about the world) but advertises nothing back (the world cannot learn about it). The `export-connected` and `export-bgp` policies we created earlier formed a chain: `export-connected` matched directly connected subnets and advertised them, passing unmatched routes to `export-bgp` via `next-policy`; `export-bgp` then matched BGP-learned routes. Deleting both policies means srl3's connected routes (10.1.3.0/24 and 10.1.5.0/24) and any transit routes are never placed into UPDATE messages.

**Why the asymmetry exists:** srl3 still receives routes from srl1 and srl2 because their export policies are intact -- they are happily advertising their subnets. So srl3 has a full routing table and host3 can reach everything. But srl1 and srl2 have no routes to 10.1.3.0/24 or 10.1.5.0/24 because srl3 is advertising nothing. From their perspective, those subnets do not exist.

**Fix (re-add both export policies):**

```
A:srl3# enter candidate
set / network-instance default protocols bgp group ebgp-peers export-policy [export-connected export-bgp]
commit now
```

**Verification:**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.1.5.2
PING 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=0 ttl=62 time=2.345 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.123 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.987 ms
--- 10.1.5.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
```

After restoring the export policy, srl3 immediately sends UPDATE messages containing its connected routes. srl1 and srl2 install them in their routing tables and connectivity is restored.

**Key lesson:** BGP session UP does not mean routes are flowing. Always check prefix counts. A session in `established` state only means the two routers can communicate -- it says nothing about whether routes are actually being exchanged. On SR Linux, the most common cause of "session up, no routes" is a missing or misconfigured export policy.

---

## Exercise 4: Break/Fix -- Link Failure with Automatic Reroute

**Continuous ping showing loss then recovery:**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 30 -i 1 10.1.5.2
PING 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=0 ttl=62 time=2.345 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.123 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.987 ms

--- link disabled here ---

64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=3 ttl=62 time=1.234 ms

--- BGP hold timer expires, session drops, route withdrawn ---
--- srl1 installs alternate path via srl2 ---

(several packets lost)

64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=10 ttl=61 time=3.456 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=11 ttl=61 time=2.123 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=12 ttl=61 time=1.876 ms
...
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=29 ttl=61 time=1.567 ms
--- 10.1.5.2 ping statistics ---
30 packets transmitted, 24 packets received, 20% packet loss
```

Notice the TTL change: before the link failure, TTL=62 (2 router hops: srl1 -> srl3). After convergence, TTL=61 (3 router hops: srl1 -> srl2 -> srl3). The network found a longer but working path.

**BGP neighbor table on srl1 showing srl3 session down:**

```
A:srl1# show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| Peer          | Group  | AS     | Admin     | Session| Rcv    | Active |
|               |        |        | State     | State  | Routes | Routes |
+===============+========+========+===========+========+========+========+
| 10.1.2.2      |ebgp-pe | 65002  | enable    |establis| 4      | 4      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| 10.1.3.2      |ebgp-pe | 65003  | enable    |active  | 0      | 0      |
|               |  ers   |        |           |        |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
```

The srl3 session (10.1.3.2) dropped to `active` state because the underlying interface went down and BGP keepalives stopped. The srl2 session now shows 4 received routes instead of 2 -- srl2 is advertising srl3's subnets because srl2 still peers with srl3 via the 10.1.6.0/24 link.

**Traceroute after convergence (traffic reroutes through srl2):**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 traceroute -n -w 2 10.1.5.2
traceroute to 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.1.1.1  1.234 ms  0.567 ms  0.432 ms
 2  10.1.2.2  1.456 ms  1.123 ms  0.987 ms
 3  10.1.6.2  1.678 ms  1.345 ms  1.234 ms

```

The path is now host1 -> srl1 (10.1.1.1) -> srl2 (10.1.2.2) -> srl3 (10.1.6.2) -> host3 (10.1.5.2). The traffic takes the longer triangle path because the direct srl1-srl3 link is down.

**What happened step by step:**

1. When ethernet-1/3 on srl1 was disabled, the srl1-srl3 BGP session lost its underlying transport.
2. After the BGP hold timer expired (~90 seconds by default), srl1 declared the session dead and withdrew the direct route to srl3's prefixes (10.1.3.0/24 and 10.1.5.0/24).
3. But srl1 still had an alternate path: srl2 peers with both srl1 (via 10.1.2.0/24) and srl3 (via 10.1.6.0/24). srl2 learned srl3's routes directly and re-advertised them to srl1 with AS path [65002, 65003].
4. srl1 installed this alternate path and traffic resumed through srl2.

**In lesson 03, disabling this same interface (ethernet-1/3 on srl1) permanently broke connectivity to host3.** The static route kept pointing at the dead link: the routing table said "send to 10.1.3.2 via ethernet-1/3" but ethernet-1/3 was down, so every packet to host3 was silently dropped. There was no mechanism to detect the failure or find an alternate path. Here, BGP detected the failure and automatically rerouted through the alternate path via srl2. This is the fundamental advantage of dynamic routing.

**Re-enable the link:**

```
A:srl1# enter candidate
set / interface ethernet-1/3 admin-state enable
commit now
```

**After re-enabling, BGP converges back to the direct path:**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 traceroute -n -w 2 10.1.5.2
traceroute to 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  10.1.1.1  1.234 ms  0.567 ms  0.432 ms
 2  10.1.3.2  1.345 ms  0.987 ms  0.876 ms
 3  10.1.5.2  1.567 ms  1.123 ms  1.012 ms
```

Traffic shifts back to the direct srl1 -> srl3 path because the direct route has a shorter AS path ([65003]) compared to the indirect route ([65002, 65003]).

**Key lesson:** Dynamic routing adapts to failures. The network healed itself. When the direct link went down, BGP found an alternate path through the triangle. When the link came back, BGP preferred the shorter path again. No human intervention was needed at any point.

## Exercise 5: Break/Fix -- Wrong ASN

**BGP neighbor table on srl2 showing `active` state:**

```
A:srl2# show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| Peer          | Group  | AS     | Admin     | Session| Rcv    | Active |

|               |  ers   |        |           |        |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| 10.1.6.2      |ebgp-pe | 65003  | enable    |establis| 2      | 1      |

+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
```

The srl1 session (10.1.2.1) shows `active` state and peer-as is 65099 (wrong). The srl3 session remains healthy.

**What `active` means:** The `active` state is confusing because it sounds like the session is working. In BGP, `active` means "actively trying to connect" -- it is actually a failure state. The state machine is stuck in a retry loop: srl2 opens a TCP connection to srl1, sends a BGP OPEN message claiming to expect peer-as 65099, but srl1 is AS 65001. srl1 checks: "This peer says I'm AS 65099, but I'm AS 65001." srl1 rejects the OPEN with a NOTIFICATION message (Bad Peer AS), tears down the TCP connection, and srl2 goes back to `active` to try again. This cycle repeats indefinitely.

`established` is the only healthy BGP state. Any other state -- `idle`, `connect`, `active`, `opensent`, `openconfirm` -- indicates a problem.

**Impact on traffic:** srl2 loses all routes learned from srl1. host2 can no longer reach host1 (10.1.1.0/24) or any subnet only reachable through srl1. However, host2 can still reach host3 because the srl2-srl3 BGP session (via 10.1.6.2) is unaffected.

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host2 ping -c 3 -W 5 10.1.1.2

--- 10.1.1.2 ping statistics ---

```

**Key lesson:** Both sides must agree on AS numbers. When debugging BGP, check session state first. If a session is stuck in `active` or `connect`, the most likely causes are: wrong peer-as, wrong peer-address, or a firewall blocking TCP port 179. The `active` state specifically suggests the TCP connection succeeds but the OPEN message is rejected -- which points to an AS number mismatch.

## Exercise 6: Break/Fix -- Stale Static Route Masks BGP

**Symptom: host1 cannot reach host2, but can still reach host3.**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 -W 5 10.1.4.2
PING 10.1.4.2 (10.1.4.2): 56 data bytes

--- 10.1.4.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.1.5.2
PING 10.1.5.2 (10.1.5.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=0 ttl=62 time=2.345 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.123 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.5.2: seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.987 ms
--- 10.1.5.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
```

Only one destination is broken. host3 works fine, so BGP itself is healthy.

**Routing table on srl1 showing the static route:**

```
A:srl1# show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary
+------------+-------+------------+-------------------+----------+
|   Prefix   | Type  | Route-Owner| Next-hop          | Metric   |
+============+=======+============+===================+==========+
| 10.1.1.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/1.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.2.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/2.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.3.0/24| local | net_inst   | ethernet-1/3.0    | 0        |
| 10.1.4.0/24| static| static     | 10.1.3.2          | 1        |
| 10.1.5.0/24| bgp   | bgp_mgr   | 10.1.3.2          | 0        |
+------------+-------+------------+-------------------+----------+
```

The critical clue: 10.1.4.0/24 shows `static` with next-hop 10.1.3.2 (srl3). But host2 is behind srl2, not srl3. The correct next-hop should be 10.1.2.2. BGP knows this -- but the static route wins.

**Why the static route wins:** Every routing source has an administrative distance -- a trust level that determines priority when multiple sources provide a route for the same prefix. On SR Linux:

| Route Source | Administrative Distance |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Local/connected | 0 |
| Static | 5 |
| BGP | 170 |

Lower distance wins. The static route (distance 5) beats the BGP route (distance 170) for 10.1.4.0/24, even though the BGP route has the correct next-hop. The BGP route is still learned and stored, but it is hidden -- the routing table installs the static route because it is more "trusted."

This is one of the most common production gotchas when migrating from static to dynamic routing. Old static routes left behind will silently override BGP-learned routes. Everything looks healthy -- BGP sessions are established, routes are being exchanged -- but traffic goes to the wrong place because a stale static route has priority.

**BGP neighbors on srl1 (all healthy -- this is the trap):**

```
A:srl1# show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| Peer          | Group  | AS     | Admin     | Session| Rcv    | Active |
|               |        |        | State     | State  | Routes | Routes |
+===============+========+========+===========+========+========+========+
| 10.1.2.2      |ebgp-pe | 65002  | enable    |establis| 2      | 1      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
| 10.1.3.2      |ebgp-pe | 65003  | enable    |establis| 2      | 2      |
|               |  ers   |        |           | hed    |        |        |
+---------------+--------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+--------+
```

Notice that srl2's session shows `Rcv: 2` but `Active: 1`. srl1 received 2 routes from srl2 (10.1.2.0/24 and 10.1.4.0/24), but only 1 is active -- 10.1.4.0/24 was received but not installed because the static route has a lower administrative distance. This `Rcv > Active` mismatch is the diagnostic clue that another routing source is overriding BGP.

**Fix (delete the stale static route):**

```
A:srl1# enter candidate
delete / network-instance default static-routes route 10.1.4.0/24
delete / network-instance default next-hop-groups group nhg-wrong
commit now
```

**Verification:**

```bash
$ docker exec clab-dynamic-routing-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.1.4.2
PING 10.1.4.2 (10.1.4.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.1.4.2: seq=0 ttl=62 time=2.345 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.4.2: seq=1 ttl=62 time=1.123 ms
64 bytes from 10.1.4.2: seq=2 ttl=62 time=0.987 ms
--- 10.1.4.2 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
```

After deleting the static route, the BGP route (with the correct next-hop 10.1.2.2) is immediately promoted from hidden to active. No BGP reconvergence is needed -- the route was already learned, it was just being suppressed.

**Key lesson:** Administrative distance determines which routing source wins when multiple sources provide the same prefix. Static routes (distance 5) beat BGP (distance 170) on SR Linux. When migrating from static to dynamic routing, always clean up old static routes -- they will silently override correct BGP routes. The diagnostic clue is a mismatch between received and active route counts in the BGP neighbor table.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dynamic routing replaces manual route management with automatic route exchange** -- routers learn about remote subnets from their BGP peers instead of relying on hand-configured static routes
2. **BGP sessions use explicit peering** -- you must configure both sides with matching AS numbers and reachable peer addresses before routes can flow
3. **SR Linux is default-deny for both import and export** -- you need an import policy to accept received routes and export policies to advertise them; export policies can be chained using `next-policy` for modular, composable route filtering
4. **BGP's best path algorithm selects between competing routes** -- it evaluates Local Preference, AS Path Length, Origin, MED, eBGP/iBGP preference, and Router ID in strict order; in this lab, AS Path Length was the deciding factor because all other attributes were equal
5. **Dynamic routing self-heals** -- link failures trigger automatic rerouting through alternate paths; the same failure that permanently broke static routing in lesson 03 was automatically recovered here
6. **BGP session states matter** -- Established is the only healthy state; Active and Connect indicate configuration mismatches despite their misleading names
7. **Administrative distance determines route priority** -- static routes (distance 5) beat BGP routes (170) on SR Linux; stale static routes silently override correct BGP routes, and the diagnostic clue is a received-vs-active route count mismatch
8. **gNMIc provides model-driven network configuration via gRPC** -- structured JSON payloads targeting YANG paths replace CLI text parsing, making network automation more reliable and programmatic
