# Lesson 0 Exercises: Container Networking -- Linux Under the Hood

Complete these exercises to reinforce your understanding of the Linux primitives under container networking.

```bash
cd lessons/clab/00-docker-networking
```

## Exercise 1: Inspect Docker's Network Plumbing

**Objective:** Trace the Linux components Docker creates when you run containers.

### Steps

1. Start two containers on the default bridge:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name c1 alpine sleep 3600
   docker run -d --name c2 alpine sleep 3600
   ```

2. Find the `docker0` bridge on the host:
   ```bash
   ip link show docker0
   ```

3. List all interfaces attached to `docker0`:
   ```bash
   ip link show master docker0
   ```
   Note the veth names, their interface indexes (the number before the colon), and the `link-netnsid` values.

4. Look inside container `c1` and find the other end of the veth pair:
   ```bash
   docker exec c1 ip addr
   ```
   Inside the container, `eth0` shows `@ifN` -- that N is the interface index of the host-side veth. Find that index in the host output from step 3 to match the pair.

5. Check the container's routing table:
   ```bash
   docker exec c1 ip route
   ```

6. Verify with Docker's own view:
   ```bash
   docker network inspect bridge
   ```

### Think about it

- What is the IP of the `docker0` bridge, and how does it relate to the container's default gateway?
- How do you match a host-side veth to its container-side eth0? (Hint: start from inside the container and look at the `@ifN` index.)
- What subnet does Docker use for the default bridge?

### Cleanup

```bash
docker rm -f c1 c2
```

## Exercise 2: Build a Container Network from Scratch

**Objective:** Manually create a namespace-based network using bridges and veth pairs -- the same primitives Docker uses.

### Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Host
        BR["br-study<br/>10.0.0.254/24"]
        subgraph red [red namespace]
            VR["veth-r<br/>10.0.0.1/24"]
        end
        subgraph blue [blue namespace]
            VB["veth-b<br/>10.0.0.2/24"]
        end
        VR --- |veth-r-br| BR
        VB --- |veth-b-br| BR
    end
```

### Steps

1. Create two network namespaces:
   ```bash
   sudo ip netns add red
   sudo ip netns add blue
   ```

2. Verify they exist:
   ```bash
   sudo ip netns list
   ```

3. Create a Linux bridge and assign it an IP:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link add br-study type bridge
   sudo ip link set br-study up
   sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.254/24 dev br-study
   ```

4. Create veth pairs and wire up the **red** namespace:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link add veth-r type veth peer name veth-r-br
   sudo ip link set veth-r netns red
   sudo ip link set veth-r-br master br-study
   sudo ip link set veth-r-br up
   ```

5. Create veth pairs and wire up the **blue** namespace:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link add veth-b type veth peer name veth-b-br
   sudo ip link set veth-b netns blue
   sudo ip link set veth-b-br master br-study
   sudo ip link set veth-b-br up
   ```

6. Configure IPs and bring interfaces up inside each namespace (but **not** the loopback yet):
   ```bash
   # Red
   sudo ip netns exec red ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev veth-r
   sudo ip netns exec red ip link set veth-r up

   # Blue
   sudo ip netns exec blue ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev veth-b
   sudo ip netns exec blue ip link set veth-b up
   ```

7. Test connectivity between namespaces:
   ```bash
   # Red to blue
   sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 3 10.0.0.2

   # Blue to red
   sudo ip netns exec blue ping -c 3 10.0.0.1

   # Either namespace to the bridge gateway
   sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 10.0.0.254
   ```

8. Now try pinging the loopback address inside a namespace:
   ```bash
   sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 127.0.0.1
   ```
   It fails. Why? The loopback interface (`lo`) starts in a DOWN state in new namespaces.

9. Bring up the loopback in both namespaces and verify:
   ```bash
   sudo ip netns exec red ip link set lo up
   sudo ip netns exec blue ip link set lo up
   sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 127.0.0.1
   ```

### Think about it

- Why did `127.0.0.1` fail before bringing up `lo`, even though pinging the other namespace worked? What does this tell you about how loopback differs from bridge-connected interfaces?
- Run `ip link show master br-study` on the host. What does each line tell you?
- How is your manual setup different from what Docker does with `docker0`? (Hint: Docker automates these exact steps.)

## Exercise 3: Enable Internet Access (NAT)

**Objective:** Add NAT/masquerade rules so your manual namespaces can reach the internet, just like Docker containers.

### Prerequisites

Complete Exercise 2 first (namespaces, bridge, and veth pairs must be in place).

### Steps

1. First, find your host's outbound interface:
   ```bash
   ip route show default
   ```
   Note the interface name after `dev` (e.g., `enp6s0`, `enp0s3`, `wlan0`). On modern Linux this is **not** `eth0` -- use whatever your system shows.

2. Add default routes in each namespace so they send non-local traffic to the bridge:
   ```bash
   sudo ip netns exec red ip route add default via 10.0.0.254
   sudo ip netns exec blue ip route add default via 10.0.0.254
   ```

3. Enable IP forwarding on the host:
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
   ```

4. Allow forwarding for br-study. Docker sets the FORWARD chain policy to DROP, which blocks our traffic:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i br-study -j ACCEPT
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -o br-study -j ACCEPT
   ```

5. Add a masquerade rule (replace `enp6s0` with your actual interface from step 1):
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o enp6s0 -j MASQUERADE
   ```

6. Test internet access from the namespaces:
   ```bash
   sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
   sudo ip netns exec blue ping -c 3 1.1.1.1
   ```

7. Inspect Docker's own NAT rules for comparison:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v
   ```

### Think about it

- What does the masquerade rule actually do to each packet? (Think about source IP rewriting.)
- Why do we need IP forwarding enabled?
- Why does Docker's FORWARD policy block our traffic, and what does Docker allow instead?
- Look at the output of `sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v` -- can you find Docker's masquerade rule for 172.17.0.0/16?

## Exercise 4: Break/Fix -- Bridge Down

**Objective:** Diagnose why namespaces lose connectivity when the bridge is down.

### Prerequisites

Complete Exercise 2 first (namespaces, bridge, and veth pairs must be in place).

### Setup (break it)

```bash
sudo ip link set br-study down
```

### Symptom

```bash
sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 10.0.0.2
# FAILS -- no response or "Network is unreachable"
```

### Your Task

1. Check the bridge state: `ip link show br-study`. What does `state DOWN` mean?
2. Check if the veth pairs are still attached: `ip link show master br-study`
3. Fix the bridge and verify ping works again.

### Think about it

- What does "state DOWN" on a bridge mean for all attached interfaces?
- How did you confirm the bridge was the problem and not the veth pairs themselves?

---

## Exercise 5: Break/Fix -- Missing Masquerade

**Objective:** Diagnose why namespaces can reach each other but not the internet.

### Prerequisites

Complete Exercises 2 and 3 (full NAT setup must be in place).

### Setup (break it)

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o enp6s0 -j MASQUERADE
```

(Replace `enp6s0` with your actual outbound interface.)

### Symptom

```bash
# This works (same subnet, local bridge)
sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 10.0.0.2

# This fails (internet)
sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 2 -W 3 8.8.8.8
```

### Your Task

1. Verify that local connectivity still works (red to blue, red to bridge)
2. Check the NAT table: `sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -v -n`. What's missing?
3. Explain why local traffic works but internet traffic doesn't -- what does masquerade do that local bridging doesn't need?
4. Fix by re-adding the masquerade rule and verify internet access.

### Think about it

- Why does removing the masquerade rule break internet access but not local connectivity?
- What does masquerade do to the source IP of outbound packets?
- How does return traffic find its way back to the namespace?

### Validate your work

Before cleaning up, run the automated tests to verify Exercises 1-3 are set up correctly. Make sure you have re-added the masquerade rule (step 4 above) before running these.

From the lesson directory (`lessons/clab/00-docker-networking/`), set up the test environment and run the tests:

```bash
cd lessons/clab/00-docker-networking
uv sync --project ../../.. --group test
uv run --project ../../.. --group test pytest tests/ -v
```

### Cleanup

You're done with the manual namespace setup from Exercises 2-5. Clean up all resources:

```bash
sudo ip netns del red
sudo ip netns del blue
sudo ip link del br-study
sudo iptables -D FORWARD -i br-study -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -D FORWARD -o br-study -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -s 10.0.0.0/24 -o enp6s0 -j MASQUERADE
```

(Replace `enp6s0` with whatever interface you used in Exercise 3.)

Remove the test virtual environment:

```bash
rm -rf ../../../.venv
```

## Bonus Exercise: Docker Compose Networking

**Objective:** See how Docker Compose creates its own bridge network (separate from docker0).

### Steps

1. Look at the provided `compose.yaml` in this directory.

2. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. List Docker networks and find the one Compose created:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   ```

4. Inspect the Compose network:
   ```bash
   docker network inspect exercises_default
   ```

5. Find the Linux bridge backing the Compose network:
   ```bash
   ip link show type bridge
   ```
   You should see a new bridge in addition to `docker0`.

6. Test that containers can reach each other by name:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec client ping -c 2 web
   ```

7. Verify with `ip link show master <bridge-name>` to see the veth pairs -- same primitives as docker0.

### Cleanup

```bash
docker compose down
```
