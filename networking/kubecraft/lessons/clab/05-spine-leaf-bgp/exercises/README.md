# Lesson 5 Exercises: Spine-Leaf BGP Fabric

Complete these exercises to understand how Clos spine-leaf fabrics provide scalable, resilient data center connectivity using eBGP.

## Exercise 1: Deploy and Configure the Fabric

**Objective:** Deploy the Clos fabric, configure eBGP on all devices, and verify end-to-end connectivity.

### Steps

1. Deploy the topology:
   ```bash
   cd lessons/clab/05-spine-leaf-bgp
   containerlab deploy -t topology/lab.clab.yml
   ```

2. Apply BGP config to all 6 routers using gNMIc (run from the `gnmic/` directory so `.gnmic.yml` provides credentials):
   ```bash
   cd gnmic
   gnmic -a clab-spine-leaf-bgp-spine1:57400 set --request-file configs/spine1-bgp.json
   gnmic -a clab-spine-leaf-bgp-spine2:57400 set --request-file configs/spine2-bgp.json
   gnmic -a clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1:57400 set --request-file configs/leaf1-bgp.json
   gnmic -a clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf2:57400 set --request-file configs/leaf2-bgp.json
   gnmic -a clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf3:57400 set --request-file configs/leaf3-bgp.json
   gnmic -a clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf4:57400 set --request-file configs/leaf4-bgp.json
   ```

3. Before verifying, examine what the config files applied. Open `gnmic/configs/leaf1-bgp.json` and identify:
   - **Routing policies:** `import-all`, `export-connected`, and `export-bgp` -- why does a default-deny NOS like SR Linux need all three?
   - **Prefix-set filter:** `host-subnets` on `export-connected` -- what does `10.20.0.0/16 mask-length-range 24..24` match, and what does it exclude?
   - **Multipath:** `maximum-paths: 2` under `afi-safi ipv4-unicast` -- what is the SR Linux default, and why does ECMP require changing it?
   - **Shared spine ASN:** Why do both spine neighbors have the same peer-as (65000)? What does RFC 7938 say about spine ASN assignment?

4. Verify all 8 BGP sessions are established:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor"
   ```
   Check all 6 devices -- each leaf should have 2 sessions (one per spine), each spine should have 4 sessions (one per leaf).

5. Verify end-to-end connectivity with cross-leaf pings:
   ```bash
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.20.2.2  # host1 -> host2
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.20.3.2  # host1 -> host3
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 ping -c 3 10.20.4.2  # host1 -> host4
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host2 ping -c 3 10.20.4.2  # host2 -> host4
   ```

### Deliverables

- BGP neighbor output from a leaf (showing 2 established sessions)
- BGP neighbor output from a spine (showing 4 established sessions)

## Exercise 2: Read the Fabric Routing Table -- Observe ECMP

**Objective:** Understand equal-cost multipath (ECMP) in a spine-leaf fabric and the configuration required to enable it.

### Steps

1. Verify that BGP multipath is configured on leaf1:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli -c "info network-instance default protocols bgp afi-safi ipv4-unicast multipath"
   ```
   You should see `maximum-paths 2`. SR Linux defaults to `maximum-paths 1` (single best path only). Without this setting, BGP picks one spine and ignores the other -- no ECMP.

2. Check leaf1's routing table:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary"
   ```

3. Look for routes to other leaves' host subnets (10.20.2.0/24, 10.20.3.0/24, 10.20.4.0/24). Each should show 2 next-hops (ECMP) -- one via each spine. The summary at the bottom should show `IPv4 prefixes with active ECMP routes: 3`.

4. Verify that only host subnets appear in BGP -- no /31 fabric link prefixes. The `host-subnets` prefix-set on `export-connected` filters these out. Compare leaf1's BGP routes to its local routes to confirm.

5. Traceroute from host1 to host4 -- run it multiple times:
   ```bash
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 traceroute -n -w 2 10.20.4.2
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 traceroute -n -w 2 10.20.4.2
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 traceroute -n -w 2 10.20.4.2
   ```
   The path is always 4 hops: host -> leaf1 -> spine -> leaf4 -> host4. But which spine may vary between runs.

6. Answer these questions:
   - How many hops between any two hosts? (Always 4: host-leaf-spine-leaf-host)
   - How many equal-cost paths exist between any two leaves? (2, one per spine)
   - What happens to bandwidth if you add a third spine? (50% more aggregate bandwidth, 3 ECMP paths)

### Deliverables

- Routing table showing ECMP entries (2 next-hops per remote leaf subnet)
- Traceroute output from multiple runs
- Answers to the 3 questions above

## Exercise 3: Break/Fix -- Spine Failure (Fabric Resilience)

**Objective:** Observe that a spine-leaf fabric survives spine failures with reduced capacity but no connectivity loss.

### Setup (break it)

```bash
docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-spine1 sr_cli
```

Inside SR Linux -- disable all interfaces:
```
enter candidate
set / interface ethernet-1/1 admin-state disable
set / interface ethernet-1/2 admin-state disable
set / interface ethernet-1/3 admin-state disable
set / interface ethernet-1/4 admin-state disable
commit now
exit
```

### Symptom

```bash
# Brief connectivity disruption, then full recovery through spine2
docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 ping -c 10 -i 1 10.20.4.2
```

### Your Task

1. Run continuous pings between hosts on different leaves:
   ```bash
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 ping -c 30 -i 1 10.20.4.2
   ```

2. Check leaf1's routing table -- ECMP entries should reduce from 2 paths to 1:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary"
   ```

3. Check BGP neighbors on leaf1 -- the spine1 session should be down:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default protocols bgp neighbor"
   ```

4. Traceroute -- all traffic now goes through spine2:
   ```bash
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host1 traceroute -n -w 2 10.20.4.2
   ```

5. Fix -- re-enable spine1:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-spine1 sr_cli
   ```
   Inside SR Linux:
   ```
   enter candidate
   set / interface ethernet-1/1 admin-state enable
   set / interface ethernet-1/2 admin-state enable
   set / interface ethernet-1/3 admin-state enable
   set / interface ethernet-1/4 admin-state enable
   commit now
   exit
   ```

6. Verify ECMP paths return to 2:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary"
   ```

### Deliverables

- Ping output showing brief loss then recovery
- Routing table before/after showing ECMP path count change (2 -> 1 -> 2)
- Explanation of fabric resilience: why losing a spine degrades capacity but not connectivity

## Exercise 4 (Challenge): Break/Fix -- Route Leak

**Objective:** Observe how a more-specific prefix can hijack traffic in a fabric.

### Setup (break it)

On leaf1, add a more-specific route that covers leaf4's host subnet:

```bash
docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli
```

Inside SR Linux:
```
enter candidate
set / routing-policy prefix-set hijack prefix 10.20.4.0/25 mask-length-range exact
set / routing-policy policy export-hijack statement 10 match prefix-set hijack
set / routing-policy policy export-hijack statement 10 action policy-result accept
set / routing-policy policy export-hijack statement 20 match protocol local
set / routing-policy policy export-hijack statement 20 action policy-result accept
set / routing-policy policy export-hijack default-action policy-result reject
set / network-instance default protocols bgp group spines export-policy [export-hijack]
set / network-instance default static-routes route 10.20.4.0/25 admin-state enable
set / network-instance default next-hop-groups group nhg-blackhole admin-state enable
set / network-instance default next-hop-groups group nhg-blackhole nexthop 1 ip-address 192.0.2.1
set / network-instance default static-routes route 10.20.4.0/25 next-hop-group nhg-blackhole
commit now
exit
```

### Symptom

```bash
# host2 and host3 CANNOT reach host4
docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host2 ping -c 3 -W 5 10.20.4.2
docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host3 ping -c 3 -W 5 10.20.4.2

# Traffic to host4 gets sucked into leaf1's blackhole route
```

### Your Task

1. Check routing tables on leaf2 and leaf3 -- look for a /25 route that should not be there:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf2 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary"
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf3 sr_cli -c "show network-instance default route-table ipv4-unicast summary"
   ```

2. Traceroute from host2 to host4 -- traffic goes to leaf1 (the hijacker) and dies:
   ```bash
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host2 traceroute -n -w 2 10.20.4.2
   ```

3. Identify the rogue /25 prefix and trace it back to leaf1.

4. Fix -- remove the hijack config on leaf1:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it clab-spine-leaf-bgp-leaf1 sr_cli
   ```
   Inside SR Linux:
   ```
   enter candidate
   delete / routing-policy prefix-set hijack
   delete / routing-policy policy export-hijack
   delete / network-instance default static-routes route 10.20.4.0/25
   delete / network-instance default next-hop-groups group nhg-blackhole
   set / network-instance default protocols bgp group spines export-policy [export-connected export-bgp]
   commit now
   exit
   ```

5. Verify host4 is reachable again:
   ```bash
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host2 ping -c 3 10.20.4.2
   docker exec clab-spine-leaf-bgp-host3 ping -c 3 10.20.4.2
   ```

### Deliverables

- Routing table showing the rogue /25 prefix
- Explanation of longest-prefix-match hijacking: why a /25 wins over a /24 even though the /24 is the legitimate route
